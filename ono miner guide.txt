.. Step 1: Prepare Firmware 
Before connecting the components, flash the ESP32 with the correct firmware. 
You will need: 
- Firmware file: ESP32 NTRIP duo.bin ( THANKS to: https://github.com/incarvr6/esp32-ntrip-DUO )
 
Using ESPHome Web Flasher: 
1. Open: https://web.esphome.io/ 
2. Connect the ESP32 to your PC via USB (hold the 'Boot' button while plugging in) 
3. Click 'Connect' and choose the COM port (if no COM port appears, install a driver. A pop-up will provide links. Alternatively, go to the 'ESP32' folder, unpack the driver archive, and right-click on silabser.inf . 'Install'.) 
4. In the popup: Select the .bin file 
5. Click 'Install' 
 
After flashing: Disconnect and reconnect the USB cable. After about 20 seconds, a new WiFi network named 'ESP32-...' should appear. 
.. Step 2: Configure the UM980 GPS Module 
1. Install the driver from the 'GPS MODULE / Driver' folder 
2. Connect the UM980 to your Windows PC via USB 
3. Copy the 'GPS MODULE' folder to your desktop 
4. Open Device Manager . Note the COM port (CH340) 
5. Open terminal in the folder (Right-click . 'Open in Terminal') 
6. Run the flashing command: 
 
.\nmeaConf.exe COM5 UM980_RTCM3_OUT.txt 
 
(Replace COM5 with your actual COM port, e.g., COM3, COM4, etc.) 
Done! 


... Step 3: Prepare the Enclosure (optional, if lid is not screwed) 
Carefully cut threads into both enclosure holes using the M3 thread cutter. 


... Step 4: Assembly & Wiring 
1. Attach double-sided tape to ESP32, fan, and UM980 
2. Cut 4 wires (each in a different color) to 6 cm, strip both ends, twist, and lightly tin them 
3. Wiring according to the following diagram: 
4010 Fan: 
ESP32 3V  . Fan + (red) 
ESP32 GND . Fan – (black) 
UM980 GPS Module: 
ESP32 TX  . UM980 RX (yellow) 
ESP32 RX  . UM980 TX (blue) 
ESP32 5V  . UM980 VCC (red) 
ESP32 GND . UM980 GND (black) 
. Step 5: Power-up 
1. Close the enclosure 
2. Connect the antennas 
3. Plug in power . The device will start automatically 
4. Now you can begin with the software setup. Follow the instructions at device setup.pdf.
